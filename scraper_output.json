    "content": "Stay BUY, with new MYR1.65 TP from MYR1.74, 21% upside with 4% FY26F yield.KKB Engineering reported a core net profit of MYR5.7m (-18% YoY) for 1H25 which missed our estimates - making up 25% of our initial FY25F. The negative deviation was mainly due to the weaker-than-expected performance of the engineering division. The group is expected to reset its activities in FY25 whereby projects have reached its tail end while it continues tendering for a new round of jobs.\nResults review.The engineering division of KKB recorded a PAT of MYR3.5m in 2Q25 (2Q24 PAT: MYR12.8m) stemming from the steel fabrication arm which saw two major projects at its tail end which related to Sarawak Shell (c.MYR300m) and the Rosmari and Marjoram (R&M) onshore gas plant in Bintulu (MYR112.6m) awarded by Samsung E&A Engineering. Nonetheless, 2Q25's engineering PAT cancelled out 1Q25's net loss of MYR3.4m. Meanwhile, the manufacturing division rebounded to a PAT of MYR4.6m from a net loss of MYR1.4m supported by KKB's supply of mild steel concrete lined pipes for a water treatment plant in Sibu and a regional water supply project in Serian.\nOrderbook.As at end-2Q25, KKB's outstanding orderbook stood at MYR127m (end-1Q25: MYR250m), while the group's tenderbook for engineering and construction as of end 2Q25 is worth MY231m. Moving forward, the group expects to submit another set of bids with a combined value of MYR650m for the engineering and manufacturing divisions) and MYR1.2bn for oil & gas jobs in 2H25 (estimated success rate of 30-40%) - of which outcomes are expected to be known in FY26.\nSince results underperformed expectations- we lower our FY25F-27F earnings by 14%, 6% and 7% as we impute more conservative job target wins for FY25 of MYR200m (from MYR300m) and tone down on our billings progress assumptions across FY25 to FY27. As such, we arrive at a new TP of MYR1.65 by pegging our FY26F EPS to an unchanged target P/E of 17x, and applying a 2% ESG premium to the stock's intrinsic value. KKB's target P/E is near the Bursa Malaysia Industrial Production Index's 10-year mean. This is justified by its position - it could benefit from Sarawak's own MYR10.8bn development expenditure for 2025 (2024: MYR9bn).\nKey rerating catalysts:Faster-than-expected wins from the oil & gas fabrication space since the last time it secured a project from the said space was in Nov 2023. Upcoming water supply schemes in Sabah which Gamuda (GAM MK, BUY, TP: MYR6.52) could likely secure, may also serve as a potential job opportunity forKKB.\nKey downside risksinclude slower-than-expected job replenishment trends.\nSource:RHB Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Maintain BUY, with new MYR1.50 TP from MYR1.45, 12% upside with 4% FY26F yield.Johor Plantations Group's 1H25 earnings are in line with our and Street estimates. FFB output should improve in 2H25 as we head towards the peak output season in 3Q25, but this may be offset by moderating CPO ASPs. We continue to like JPG for its strong ESG credentials, and attractive valuation - the stock is trading at 12.8x FY26F P/E, which is at the low-end of its peer range of 12-15x.\n2Q25 core earnings marginally improved 3% QoQ (+44% YoY)to MYR72.5m, bringing 1H25 core profit to MYR143m (+48% YoY). This is in line with our and consensus estimates, accounting for 52% of full-year forecasts. JPG declared a DPS of 1.3 sen in 2Q25, bringing 1H25 DPS to 2.3 sen (37% payout ratio).\n1H25 FFB output dropped to -8% YoY (2Q25: +25% QoQ, -6% YoY),no thanks to the dry season weather in Johor, but JPG guided that from July onwards, weather conditions have been favourable. YTD-July, FFB output slightly improved to -6% YoY, albeit below our and management's initial guidance of +3 to +5% for FY25. While JPG is hoping for a larger pick up in 2H25, with peak output in September/October, it has now targeted for a lower FFB growth target for FY25F, citing 0% to +5% YoY. We remain conservative, and trim our FFB growth estimates further to +1% for FY25 (from +3%) and +3% to +4% for FY26-27 (from +5%).\nJPG recorded 1H25 CPO ASPs of MYR4,605 (+11% YoY),ie a 6% premium over the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) price, while its PK ASP shot up by 53% YoY to MYR3,808/tonne (10% premium over the MPOB price), owing to the tight lauric oil market. As usual, JPG has secured a premium over the MPOB price for 70-80% of output in 2025 of MYR200-250/tonne. We keep our CPO ASP premium of 3% for FY25F-27F but adjusted our PK ASP premium to +6% for FY25F-27F, from +4.5%.\nCPO unit cost rose by 3% YoY to MYR2,263/tonne in 1H25(vs our flattish unit cost assumption), due to weaker output. As JPG is targeting for production to pick up in 2H25, it maintains its FY25 cost assumption of MYR2,200-2,300/tonne (flattish YoY). In terms of application, JPG applied 49% of its FY25 fertiliser requirements in 1H25 (fertiliser tendered at prices lower at -11% YoY for FY25). We maintain our unit cost assumption.\nWe trim earnings slightly by 3% for FY25F-26F and 4% for FY27F, after adjusting for lower FFB growth assumptions and higher PK ASP premium.\nMaintain BUY, with a higher MYR1.50 TP based on new 14x 2026F P/E, from 13x, at the higher end of its peers' 12-15x. We believe this is justified given its robust ESG credentials which led to higher ASPs realised, and promising downstream prospects, starting in FY26F.\nSource:RHB Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Still BUY and MYR6.55 TP, 22% upside and 3% FY26F yield.We expect Sunway Construction to chalk in a 2Q25 core profit ranging between MYR70m and MYR85m (translating into a YoY growth of 88-129% backed by a combination of progress for its internal jobs and some data centre (DC) jobs. Our observations in Ipoh and Cyberjaya indicate that the Sunway City Ipoh Mall (SCIM) and the Project Services Request (PSR) multinational corp (MNC) DC job has reached commendable progress in June and July.\nAs of end Mar 2025, SCIM (slated for completion in 1Q27)was only 11% completed but during our visit in Jul 2025, we estimate that progress may have reached to around 20-25% (Figure 1). Separately, our observation for SCGB's DC projects namely the PSR MNC in Cyberjaya has also seen commendable advancement with progress likely being at 30-35% in late June (in our view) compared to 19% as of end March).\nHaving a parent with solid prospects. Sunway (SWB MK, BUY, TP: MYR5.81)will be developing a Transport Oriented Development (TOD) project; Seremban Sentral (estimated GDV: MYR2.2bn). Conservatively assuming that construction cost is 40% of GDV, the potential construction value could be around MYR880m. We do not rule out the possibility of SCGB being a front runner for this project in light of its involvement for the Rapid Transit System TOD project at Bukit Chagar, Johor Bahru.\nHealthcare arm of SWB to provide a steady job pipeline. Putrajaya Holdings and Sunway Healthcare Holdings have signed a heads of agreement to jointly develop a private tertiary medical centre in Precinct 7, Putrajaya. The first component of the medical centre is expected to house a tertiary hospital with over 300 beds. Taking the minimum 300 bed capacity as a base - we envisage that the potential construction value could be between MYR400m and MYR600m. Other hospitals in the pipeline include the Iskandar Puteri in Johor, Paya Terubong in Penang and Kota Bahru in Kelantan.\nNo changes to our earnings estimates.Hence, our TP of MYR6.55 is unchanged - which is derived by pegging the FY26F EPS to an unchanged target P/E of 23.5x and ascribing a 2% ESG premium. This is justified by SCGB's ROE being the highest among its peers, in addition to above-industry ROEs coupled with job prospects from its parent which has a strong presence in Ipoh and Johor. The stock is currently trading at a 20x FY26F P/E which we view may still have room to go higher (provided that new DC wins come in). SCGB was trading around 15-17x during the 2017 construction upcycle (with no DC factor).\nOther developments to keep investors interested in the stockinclude Segment 2 of Penang Light Rail Transit and the potential expansion of SCIM. Key risk: Lower-than expected job wins.\nSource:RHB Research- 15 Aug 2025",

However, sentiment remained broadly supported by Trump’s 90-day tariff truce with China (through 10 November), which offers a window for de-escalation and paves the way for a potential Trump-Xi summit later this year.\nUS.After falling as much as 232 pts, the Dow narrowed its decline to end -11 pts at 44,911 after July PPI rose 0.9% MoM and 3.3% YoY—sharply above forecasts—dampening hopes for a larger Fed rate cut in September. Odds of a 25bps cut remain high (85–91%), but bets on a 50bps move faded. On economic data, investors are ready to scour retail sales report tonight for a readout on how US households are feeling about the economy. On corporate front, Intel rallied 7% on report Trump administration is considering stake in chipmaker.\nMalaysia.The KLCI slipped 5.6 pts to 1,581.1, snapping a seven-day winning streak totalling 59.6 pts, mirroring weaker regional sentiment. Market breadth narrowed to 0.66 (vs. 1.77 prior), with turnover down 11% DoD to 2.40bn shares worth RM2.66bn (-13% DoD). Foreign outflows persisted for a 15th consecutive session (-RM104m, Aug MTD: -RM1.54bn, YTD: -RM14.61bn). In contrast, local institutions emerged as major net buyers at +RM98m (Aug MTD: +RM1.68bn; YTD: +RM12.86bn) alongside local retailers (+RM6m, Aug MTD: -RM136m, YTD: +RM1.76bn).\nTechnical viewAfter surging 73.3 pts MTD in August, the KLCI slipped 5.6 pts to 1,581.1 yesterday, snapping a seven-session rally after touching an intraday high of 1,595. The spinning top-like candlestick suggests potential for a healthy pullback, though a sharp correction appears unlikely. Key support levels are at 1,571 (61.8% FR) and 1,557 (200D MA), with a decisive break below 1,557 exposing further downside to 1,547 (downtrend line from 1,685) and 1,535 (50% FR). Barring a breakdown, we expect consolidation to be followed by a resumption of the uptrend towards 1,600 and 1,615 (76.4% FR).\nOutlookThe recent reduction in US-Malaysia tariffs (25% →19%), a pragmatic rollout of the 13MP, and easing US-China trade tensions—underpinned by Trump’s proposed 90-day truce—provide a constructive backdrop for the KLCI. This is further reinforced by strengthening odds of a Fed rate cut in September, a firmer ringgit, and attractive valuations (CY26 P/E at 13.6x vs 5Y mean of 17.2x), supporting a favourable near-term bias.\nTechnically, a decisive close above 1,587 (15 May high) would confirm a breakout, paving the way toward the 1,600–1,615 resistance zone. While a brief pullback is possible after the 67.8-pt August rally, the near-term bias remains constructive.\nHowever, near-term volatility may persist, weighed by:•    Persistent foreign selling: YTD outflows of RM14.61bn—the highest since 2020’s RM24.6bn pandemic exodus.•    Tariff overhang as Malaysia awaits clarification from the US on Malaysia-made chips after Trump proposed 100% levy on semiconductor chips made outside US.•    Muted earnings season: Limited upside catalysts from corporate results.•    Domestic policy risks: Ongoing concerns over subsidy rationalisation and potential SST expansion may dampen consumer sentiment and cloud earnings visibility.\nVIRTUAL PORTFOLIOWe had squared off IOICORP (2.7% gain), OBHB (3.2% gain), MRCB (-2.7% loss), TECHTRONICS (8% gain) and MAYBANK (2.7% gain) in our virtual portfolio stocks yesterday.\nSource: Hong Leong Investment Bank Research - 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Investment Highlights\nJohor Plantations Group (JPG) reported a decent set of 1HFY25 results. The group’s net profit climbed by 51.6% YoY to RM151.1mil in 1HFY25 underpinned by higher palm product prices and lower fertiliser costs. In spite of a 12.8% QoQ fall in CPO price in 2QFY25, JPG managed to sustain its net profit at RM75.2mil due to a 30.2% surge in the sales volume of CPO. Average CPO price slid to RM4,331/tonne in 2QFY25 from RM4,969/tonne in 1QFY25. We maintain BUY with a target price of RM1.72/share as we like JPG for its pure exposure to CPO prices and premium selling prices.\nBUY at a higher TP of RM1.72/share (vs. RM1.67/share previously).We derived JPG's TP of RM1.72/share by applying a of 15x on FY26F EPS of 11.5 sen The PE of 15x is the multiple that we used to value Genting Plantations (GenP). We believe that JPG should trade at the same PE as GenP due to its high leverage to CPO prices, and strategic location of its oil palm estates in Johor.\nJPG's 1HFY25 net profit of RM151.1mil was 6% above our forecast and 5% above consensus.The group's results exceeded our expectations due to a higher-than-expected gross profit margin and lower-than-estimated interest expense. We have raised JPG's FY25F net profit by 4.4% to account for this.\nLarge RSPO premium.JPG's selling price of RM4,605/tonne in 1HFY25 (1HFY24: RM4,144/tonne) was RM215/tonne higher than MPOB's average spot price of RM4,390/tonne. This is due to strong demand for RSPO-certified palm products. We expect demand for Identity Preserved RSPO-certified palm products to remain healthy as the EUDR will be implemented on 30 December 2025.\nFFB production slid by 7.8% YoY in 1HFY25.This was due to the floods in 1QFY25., which affected harvesting. Since then, FFB output has recovered. JPG's FFB production climbed by 25% QoQ in 2QFY25. We expect the group's FFB output to achieve the highest level in August or September.\nCompany profile\nJohor Plantations Group 20 May 2025 Company profile Johor Plantations Group (JPG) is involved in the upstream segment of the palm oil supply chain. Going forward, the group plans to venture into palm refining. Construction of the refinery started in FY24 and is expected to be completed in 2HFY26.\nJPG's earnings are from the sale of palm products.\nJPG's customers are refineries in Johor, which include Intercontinental Specialty Fats, Palmaju Edible Oils and PGEO Group.\nJPG's operations are mainly in Johor.\nJPG's competitive advantage lies in the strategic location of its estates in Johor and Identity Preserved (IP) RSPO- certification of its palm products. Due to the surge in land prices in Johor, JPG's estates are worth more than their book values. The IP certification allows the group to sell CPO at a RM100/tonne to RM250/tonne premium above MPOB prices.\nInvestment thesis and catalysts\nWe have a BUY on JPG as it would benefit from resilient CPO prices.\nShare price catalysts are a jump in CPO prices and plantation earnings. We think that an acquisition or disposal of land would also be a share price kicker.\nValuation methodology\nWe applied a PE of 15x onJPG's FY26F EPS to arrive at its TP of RM1.72/share. The PE of 15x is the same PE that we have applied to arrive atGenting Plantations' (GenP) fair value. We believe thatJPGdeserves to trade at the same PE asGenPdue to its premium selling prices and high leverage to CPO prices.\nRisk factors\nKey risks are a fall in CPO prices and rise in costs of fertiliser and wages.\nA fall of RM100/tonne in CPO price would affect JPG's net profit by 5% to 7% assuming everything else remains constant.\nSource:AmInvest Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Profit Taking Activities May Persist\nMarket Review\nMY:Thursday's session saw the local bourse take a breather, with losses in Utilities heavyweights like TENAGA (-12.0 sen) dampening the sentiment; the latter was due its tax overhang concerns to be priced into its valuation. Broader view, Property (+0.39%) outperformed, while Transportation & Logistics (-1.11%) declined the most.\nUS:Wall Street stalled as July's PPI increased stronger-than-anticipated; it grew 0.9% MoM and 3.3% YoY and has dampened hopes for imminent Fed rate cuts. The S&P 500 barely rose to a new closing high, while the Dow and Nasdaq edged marginally lower. Small-cap sectors were hit the hardest.\nThe Day Ahead\nUS:Wall Street took a breather after July's PPI came in above consensus, tempering the earlier euphoria over a possible rate cut in September that had swept the Wall Street. We believe the market is still anticipating easing trade tensions, which could lift the market sentiment going forward. Meanwhile, UNH jumped post-market after Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake, despite concerns over ongoing lawsuits. In the semiconductor space, Intel's share price jumped +8% after reports that the US government plans to take a stake in the company. In the commodities market, Brent oil rebounded towards USD66/bbl, while both gold and CPO retreated to USD3,333/oz and RM4,407/MT, respectively.\nMY:Tracking Wall Street's mixed performance, we expect further profit-taking activities to emerge on the local bourse. However, traders may shift their attention to Plantation stocks like JPG, which posted +50% YoY growth in its bottom-line. Besides, we believe the overall data center theme will continue to support the Construction, M&E and Utility segments in the near term; with the latter also being boosted by the government's NETR initiative. While the technology sector has pulled back, we expect the Apple's USD100bn investment pledge could provide support for stocks like UNISEM, INARI, and FRONTKN.\nFBMKLCI Technical Outlook\n\nThe local bourse took a breather on Thursday yet still well above all the MA lines, with technical indicators are mixed positive at the current juncture; the MACD histogram expanded above zero, but the RSI is near overbought region. Resistance is anticipated around 1,696-1,601, while support is located at 1,561-1,566.\nCompany Briefs\nMalaysian developer Sime Darby Property Bhd(SIMEPROP) is in talks with banks for a loan of as much as RM3bn (US$714m) to fund the building of a data centre that will be leased to Google, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed loan will have a tenure of five years and carry an extension option of as long as two years, the people said. Discussions are ongoing and details could change, they added. Sime Darby Property didn't respond to a request for comment. (The Edge)\nNewly-listedCuckoo International (MAL) Bhd(CKI) posted a 1.83% fall in second quarter net profit versus the first quarter, dragged down by listing expenses of RM4.7m and higher net impairment losses on financial instruments. Its net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 (2QFY2025) totalled RM27.35m, compared with RM27.86m in 1QFY2025. Revenue, however, rose 3.51% to RM306.67m from RM296.28m, mainly boosted by stronger contributions from the CUCKOO co-created segment. The CUCKOO branded segment contributed 78.5% of total revenue during the quarter, while the CUCKOO co-created segment accounted for 21.3%. (The Edge)\nKeyfield International Bhd(KEYFIELD) saw its net profit drop by 5.26% in the second quarter, due to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessel (OSV) and reduced daily charter rates, despite booking a RM25.7m gain from a vessel disposal. Keyfield is involved in the vessel chartering business and mainly provides offshore accommodation and related services. Its net profit came in at RM66.36m for the three months ended June 30, 2025 (2QFY2025), down from RM70.04m a year earlier, which brings its earnings per share to 8.23 sen from 9.37 sen previously. Its revenue for the quarter under review fell 33.67% to RM131.97m from RM198.98m last year. (The Edge)\nProperty developerI-Bhd(IBHD) more than doubled its net profit in the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 (2QFY2025), driven by stronger contributions across all business segments, namely leisure and hospitality, property development, and property investment. Net profit came in at RM11.45m, up 110% from RM5.45m a year ago. Earnings per share for 2QFY2025 surged to 0.62 sen from 0.29 sen a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 12% to RM62.3m from RM55.53m in 2QFY2024. No dividend was declared during the quarter.

(The Edge)\nFreight and logistics companySwift Haulage Bhd's (SWIFT) second quarter net profit was down 19.02% from a year ago, hit by higher administrative and operating expenses, finance cost and tax expenses, despite higher revenue. Net profit came in at RM6.75m in the financial year ended June 30, 2025 (2QFY2025), compared to RM8.33m in 2QFY2024. Earnings per share was lower at 0.77 sen in 2QFY2025, down from 0.95 sen previously. Its administrative and operating expenses climbed 23.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM36.1m in 2QFY2025 from RM29.21m, while finance costs rose 4.7% to RM9.42m from RM9m. Its tax expense increased by 25.6% to RM2.69m from RM2.14m. Quarterly revenue rose 9.18% y-o-y to RM188.75m, helped by the freight forwarding, land transportation and warehousing business segments. The group declared an interim dividend of 0.8 sen per share, payable on Oct 10. (The Edge)\nN2N Connect Bhd(N2N) has posted a 41% year-on-year rise in second quarter net profit to RM3.19m from RM2.26m a year ago, due to lower operating expenses and an increase in contributions from its associate. Earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (2QFY2025) increased to 0.57 sen from 0.41 sen. N2N, one of two main providers of direct market access platform services to stockbroking firms in Malaysia, said the quarterly core profit - excluding unrealised forex and non- recurring gains or losses - stood at RM2.54m, up 48.6% from RM1.71m in 2QFY2024. Revenue, however, fell 19% year-on-year to RM22.4m from RM27.66m, dragged down by lower contributions from one-time implementation, info terminal business, managed networks, and subscription and transaction-based trading solutions. (The Edge)\nMalakoff Corp Bhd(MALAKOF) has appointed Syahrunizam Samsudin as its group chief executive officer (CEO), effective Sept 1. The appointment follows the resignation of Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib, who is stepping down after nearly five years as managing director and group CEO. He joined the independent power producer company in December 2020. Malakoff is known as Malaysia's largest independent power producer with a generating capacity of 6,953MW, complemented by an expanding renewable energy portfolio of 173MW. (The Edge)\nChin Hin Group Property Bhd(CHGP) said it will divest its commercial vehicle and bodyworks operations by selling its entire stakes in four subsidiaries for RM74m. \"The proposed disposals is a strategic decision to enable the company to focus on its core business of property development - it allows the company to realise the value of its investment, streamlines its operations and enhances financial flexibility,\" Chin Hin said. The company added that the disposals are expected to yield a pre-tax gain of RM2.4m. The subsidiaries, which Chin Hin acquired between 2004 and 2015 for a total cost of investment amounting to RM64.92m, collectively contributed an unaudited profit after tax of RM125,318 for the financial period ended May 31, 2025.

    "content": "We came away from the recent management meeting with mixed views. While we acknowledge the group's strategy emphasis on balance sheet strength and asset monetisation, shift in portfolio diminish its diversification profile\nDisposal of Edotco could lower net debt/EBITDA ratio to 0.9-1.3x (from 3x)\nMaintain HOLD rating with a higher TP of RM2.56\nMonetisation ofEdotco&Link Netto drive capital recycling\nAxiata reaffirmed that its 5*5 strategy, anchored on 5 growth pillars: i) synergy delivery in CelcomDigi, ii) market reform in Indonesia, iii) resilience in frontier markets, iv) sustainable value creation for InfraCo, and v) scaling digital business. Near-term priorities remain centred on CelcomDigi integration and XLSmart. Over the medium-term, management is prioritising value realisation from Edotco and Link Net to support capital recycling and deleveraging with longer-term ambitions to scale ADA and Boost ahead of potential monetisation.\nEdotco's disposal to de-risk the balance sheet\nWith net debt/EBITDA at 3.0x in 1Q25, the potential sale of Edotco (estimated enterprise value US$3.0-3.5bn) could generate RM4.0-5.3bn in cash proceeds, given Edotco's debt at RM6.1bn (or 27% of total group borrowings), a divestment could lower the group's net debt/EBITDA ratio to 0.9-1.3x. Malaysia and Bangladesh are Edotco's key markets, contributing 42% and 34% of 1Q25 Edotco's revenue, respectively, with tower portfolios of 6.4k (18.9%) and 16.8k (49.6%) sites. The implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.8-9.1x is in line with the sector average, and provides liquidity for reinvestment and shareholder value creation.\nMaintain HOLD with a higher TP ofRM2.56\nWe raise our 2026-27E earnings forecasts by 21-26% to incorporate higher savings from network integration synergies and stronger JV contributions, driven by the incorporation of higher earnings assumptions from XL. We lift Axiata's 12-month SOP-based TP to RM2.56 (from RM2.08), reflecting our higher target EV/EBITDA multiple for Edotco at 9x (from 5x) to capture the potential transaction premium. While the deleveraging benefits are clear, frontier market exposure and earnings volatility amid macro environment headwinds temper our near-term view. Maintain HOLD. Upside risks include stronger-than-expected earnings delivery and an improvement in regional economic conditions, while downside risks stem from weaker-than-expected earnings should regional economic conditions deteriorate.\nMore value unlocks on the horizon.Axiata reaffirmed its 5*5 strategy, which aimed at delivering both operational efficiency and value creation. The strategy's pillars include: i) synergy realisation at CelcomDigi, ii) structural transformation in Indonesia, iii) resilience in frontier markets, iv) sustainable value creation for InfraCo, and v) monetisation of digital businesses. The near-term core focus remains on CelcomDigi and XLSmart, while medium-term plans are to focus on crystallising value from Edotco and Link Net to fund capital recycling and deleveraging. Longer-term growth will be driven by scaling ADA and Boost towards eventual monetisation. To recap, CelcomDigi has delivered RM555m in synergies and dividends with XLSmart targeting US$300-400m in annual pre-tax cost synergies, while Robi/Dialog has jointly reduced US$ debt by US$93m. We view the strategy's focus on balance sheet discipline and monetisation focus positively. However, portfolio rebalancing may heighten earnings volatility by reducing diversification and increasing exposure to macro-sensitive frontier markets.\nEdotco monetisation could improve net debt/EBITDA to 0.9-1.3x.Edotco has long been identified for value unlocking, with the proposed idea of an IPO back in 2018. The plan has resurfaced several times since, gaining renewed momentum in early 2025 following the sale of Edotco Myanmar. Under Axiata's 5*5 strategy, the group classifies Edotco as a monetisable asset, while the Edotco 4.0 strategy focuses on both operational optimisation and monetisation over 2024-2026. Although no firm deadline has been set, management is actively exploring strategic options to crystallise. With net debt/EBITDA at 3.0x in 1Q25, a full disposal of Axiata's 63% stake valued in the media report at US$3.0-3.5bn (RM12.7-14.8bn) could generate RM4.0-5.3bn in cash proceeds, potentially reducing the group's net debt/EBITDA to 0.9-1.3x.\nEdotco valuation implies 7.8-9.1x EV/EBITDA.Based on annualised 1Q25 figures, the indicative enterprise value forEdotcoimplies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.8-9.1x, well above the <1Ã— multiple from the US$90m (RM380.4m) sale of its Myanmar tower operations, which reflected the challenging operating environment challenging operating environment. Myanmar previously contributed 12% ofEdotco's revenue in 2022 before classified as an asset held for sale in 4Q23, ceasing to contribute toAxiata's core earnings thereafter. As of 1Q25, Malaysia and Bangladesh remainEdotco's largest revenue contributors, accounting for 42% and 34% of revenue, respectively in 1Q25. In terms of tower count, Malaysia operates 6.4k towers (18.9%) while Bangladesh leads with 16.8k towers (49.6%). This market concentration, coupled with the scale of these portfolios, should command a valuation premium overEdotco's smaller regional operations. Applying historical regional tower transaction at 8-12x EV/EBITDA multiple, we view the indicative valuation range of US$3.0-3.5bn as justified.\n2Q25 results lower YoY.We expect Axiata's 2Q25 core net profit to decline QoQ and YoY, falling to RM110-120m (2Q24: RM183m; 1Q25: RM131m) mainly due to the absence of XL's revenue contribution following the completion of the XLSmart merger in Apr25. XLSmart will be equity-accounted as a jointly controlled entity from 2Q25 onwards. XL had previously accounted for 44% of group revenue in 1Q25. On a positive note, we expect a sequential recovery at Dialog, with management noting that Sri Lanka is emerging from its economic crisis, underpinned by currency stabilisation and a rebound in tourism, which should lift telco demand alongside improving consumer sentiment.\n2025 guidance focuses on a single headline KPI.Management has withdrawn the low single-digit revenue growth target from its 2025 headline KPIs as the group shifts its near-term focus towards asset monetisation to reduce debt at the holding company level. As for the EBIT level, the group reiterated the guidance for high single-digit EBIT growth forecasts based on a pro forma 2024 EBIT baseline of RM1.9bn (assuming XL's deconsolidation and new XLSmart recognised under equity method accounting).\nRaise EPS by 21-26% on lower depreciation and higher contribution from JV.We raise our 2026-27E earnings by 21-26% mainly on 1) lower depreciation assumptions to capture potential savings from network integration synergies and the planned decommissioning of 20-30% of overlapping XLSmart sites, and 2) raising JV contributions by 67-73% over 2026-27E, reflecting the incorporation of higher earnings assumptions from XL. Despite the 15% YoY revenue decline in 2026E and only modest 4% YoY growth in 2027E, these should sustain earnings growth of 23% and 5% YoY over 2026-27E. Core net profit margins are projected to improve to 4.3% in 2026-27E from 3.4% in 2025, driven by stronger JV contributions.\nShort-term YoY revenue declines post-XLSmart merger.We forecast Axiata's revenue to contract 27% YoY in 2025E following the completion of the XL merger in Apr25. We expect revenue to further decline by 15% YoY in 2026E on the absence of XL's contribution, before recovering by a modest 4% YoY in 2027E on the back of steady performance from Axiata's subsidiaries. EBITDA is expected to mirror this revenue trajectory. At the EBIT level, XL contributed RM369m in 1Q25, which is incorporated into our 2025E earnings forecasts. We anticipate XL's EBIT to grow 9% YoY in 2025, underpinned by ongoing cost-optimisation initiatives.\nDividend guidance remains intact.Axiata has maintained a DPS of 10sen since 2023, translating to a payout ratio of 60-75%. Despite the anticipated earnings dilution from 2025E onwards following XLSmart merger, we forecast DPS to remain at 10sen for 2025-27E, implying a higher payout ratio of 150-190% dividend yield of 3.7%. This is consistent with management's commitment to a minimum annual DPS of 10sen, supported by dividend inflows from key associates and subsidiaries, as well as proceeds from asset disposals, including the XLSmart transaction, which is expected to sustain the payout.\nValuation and recommendation\nBalance risk-reward profile.Axiata's share price has rallied 56% from its Mar25 low, buoyed by improving market sentiment and optimism over ongoing value-unlocking strategies, notably the potential monetisation of Edotco. While this has underpinned the recent re-rating, we see limited scope for a meaningful earnings uplift. Edotco disposal could further tilt earnings exposure towards higher-risk frontier markets such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Cambodia. Earnings are also expected to be diluted from the XLSmart merger, with contributions now equity-accounted rather than fully consolidated. Although telcos typically offer defensiveness during periods of market uncertainty, Axiata's forward PER of 44x is above its 3-year historical average, suggesting valuations already reflect its near-term prospects. Elevated macro risks in key frontier markets and the absence of near-term catalysts are likely to cap any further upside further.\nMaintain HOLD with a higher TP of RM2.56.We lift Axiata's 12-month SOP-based TP to RM2.56 (from RM2.08), reflecting our higher target EV/EBITDA multiple for Edotco at 9x (from 5x) to capture the potential transaction premium. We view this as fair, given the 9x multiple is in line with the valuation among the SEA tower operators. While positive on balance sheet deleveraging and value-unlocking initiatives, earnings volatility, sizeable frontier markets exposure, and persistent macro headwinds may cap share price upside. Maintain HOLD rating.\nKey risks to our HOLD call.Key upside risks include stronger-than-expected earnings delivery and improvement in regional economic conditions. Downside risk would arise from weaker-than-expected earnings due to deterioration in regional economic conditions and inability to monetise its assets.\nSource:Phillip Capital Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Downgrade to NEUTRAL.Swift Haulage Berhad’s (Swift) 2QFY25 core PATAMI missed expectations, with forecasts maintained pending the results briefing. For 2HFY25, container haulage margins may see some support from an expected industry-wide capacity gap following new axle load rules, though volumes could remain soft, while the warehousing segment is projected to gain from added capacity and improved utilisation. Our target price is unchanged at RM0.43 (11x FY26F EPS or -0.5SD from the 5-year historical sector’s mean). We downgrade the stock to NEUTRAL as the positives of the stock have been priced in following a +10% share price increase since our last report.\nBelow expectations.Swift’s core PATAMI stood at RM12.8m in 1HFY25, falling short of expectations at 41% of both our and consensus full-year forecasts as margins came under pressure. The Group declared a first interim single-tier dividend of 0.8 sen for the reported period, representing a 55% dividend payout ratio. Container haulage was the lone laggard. Revenue rose a solid +9.2%yoy with gains across most segments.\nContainer haulage was the exception,recording a -1.6%yoy drop in revenue and a -17.4%yoy fall in EBIT, likely due to softer gateway cargo volumes compounded by heightened competition. Land transportation delivered a strong +14.4%yoy revenue increase, but EBIT declined -24.6%yoy as trips shifted toward shorter hauls. Meanwhile, the freight forwarding segment recorded a strong +50.9%yoy increase in revenue, boosted by project cargo activity. Altogether, core PATAMI was largely unchanged, slipping marginally by -0.1%yoy, weighed by higher operating, finance, and tax expenses.\nShorter-haul trips drove margin weakness.Sequentially, revenue inched up by +1.7%qoq, with container haulage remaining the weakest performer, posting a -3.8%qoq drop in revenue and a -6.0%qoq decline in EBIT. Land transportation delivered the strongest revenue growth at +12.5%qoq, though the -36.8%qoq decline in EBIT appears to be driven by the higher mix of lower-margin shorter-haul trips noted earlier. Overall, core PATAMI dropped -25.2%qoq, with margin narrowing by -1.0 ppt.\nEarnings estimates.Our projections remain unchanged pending the upcoming results briefing.\nSource:MIDF Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Result Preview\nSamaiden is due to release its 4QFY25 result in the final week of August. We expect progress of current projects to pick up further, which may potentially lead to another record-breaking quarter. To recap, key ongoing utility-scale projects include the:\n(1) 10MWac Bahau Power CGPP Project(2) 14MWac Legasi Greem Power CGPP Project(3) 30MWac Nextenaga LSS4 Project(4) 10MWac Pax RE LSS5 Project.(5) 27.6MWac GVU LSS5 Project.\nThe two CGPP projects are due for completion by August and September 2025, while the Nextenaga LSS4 project - which was awarded on a fast-track basis - is due for completion by January 2026. As such, we expect these projects to contribute meaningfully to the upcoming 4QFY25 result. In addition, we expect some margin improvement as the CGPP projects’ panel installation phase is expected to pick up in earnest during the quarter.\nIn summary, we estimate 4QFY25 earnings to come in at between RM6mn-8mn, representing between 33%-78% QoQ core earnings growth and 30%-73% YoY earnings growth. This is estimated to bring FY25F core net profit to between RM19mn-21mn, a growth of 27%-41% YoY.\nSolid Orderbook and Replenishment Prospects\nWe estimate SAMAIDEN’s latest outstanding orderbook at RM472mn, representing 2.1x the group’s FY24 revenue. SAMAIDEN is targeting to hit a RM1bn orderbook with the next 12 months, which will be supported by prospective job wins under LSS5 and upcoming EPCC contracts under the LSS5+ bidding cycle, which entail an aggregate 4GW solar capacity to be constructed with estimated EPCC potential of RM12bn-14bn. We expect LSS6 to be launched by year-end, entailing potentially another 2GW capacity auction. So far, SAMAIDEN has secured two EPCC jobs under LSS5 with aggregate capacity of 37.6MWac and project value of RM146mn. The group is targeting to maintain its 10% share of LSS EPCC jobs.\nProactive Cost Management\nSAMAIDEN has locked in solar modules to meet its requirement (for own asset construction) to take advantage of the current record low prices of ~USD0.09/watt. Given this proactive cost management, we believe PIRR is likely to remain intact for SAMAIDEN’s upcoming solar assets (CGPP and LSS5), notwithstanding any potential increase in market solar module prices in the future.\nFor the EPCC segment, we gather that contract terms and conditions allow for a pass-through of fluctuations in EPCC cost beyond a 5-10% range of the original proposals, wherein the proposals itself, factors in provisions beyond prevailing component costs at the time of proposal submissions. These are among contingency measures undertaken after having seen the industry being negatively impacted during LSS4 project execution when solar module prices spiked postCovid.\nNew Version of NEM Contemplated\nBased on recent newsflows, the government is currently reviewing the Net Energy Metering (NEM) program that expired end-June 2025. A new scheme is being contemplated, which might be a hybrid between the NEM and Self Consumption (SELCO) scheme, or possibly a new program altogether. This could be a catalyst for rooftop solar, depending on the final structure and mechanism. Currently, rooftop solar is estimated to account for 25% of SAMAIDEN’s orderbook.\nEarnings Revision\nGiven our expectation of stronger project progress and slightly better margins than previously anticipated, we raise FY25F/26F/27F net profit by 10%/4%/1%.\nNet Value Accretion From Three New FiT Wins\nSAMAIDEN recently won the bid to develop three bioenergy plants with aggregate capacity of 18MW under the latest Feed in Tariff 2.0 (FiT2.0) bidding cycle. Our channel checks, however, suggests that SAMAIDEN might consider surrendering one of the previously won FiT quotas for a 7MW biomass plant in Tangkak, Johor, which will be replaced by a new quota under FiT2.0, due its decision to shift to a new project location (albeit still within the same district). Nevertheless, on a net basis, value of the three new FiT2.0 plants, estimated at an aggregate RM61mn (equity value), more than offsets the loss of the original 7MW Tangkak biomass project (estimated equity value of RM37mn).\nValuation & Recommendation\nFollowing the earnings revision, we raise our SOP-derived TP toRM1.47(from RM1.38 previously) and re-affirm ourBuycall. Our valuation also updates SAMAIDEN’s latest asset pipeline, having factored in the three new bioenergy assets won under FiT2.0 and omits the previous 7MW Tangkak biomass project.\nWe continue to like SAMAIDEN as one of the key beneficiaries of an upcycle in RE plant-up underpinned by a solid orderbook, strong net cash position and strong pipeline of RE assets to boost recurring income. Key catalysts: (1) LSS5 and LSS5+ EPCC contract awards; (2) CRESS/CREAM EPCC contract awards; (3) New generation asset wins under LSS5+ and CRESS. Key risks are a sharp rise in raw material cost such as solar modules and delays in project implementation.\nSource:TA Research- 15 Aug 2025",

    "content": "Review & Outlook\nThe local market dipped on Thursday, as profit-taking emerged following the recent uptrend, with losses led by the transportation, technology, and consumer products sectors. The FBM KLCI dropped 5.55 points to close at 1,581.05, off an early high of 1,595.31 and low of 1,575.79, as losers crowded gainers 611 to 404, on lower turnover of 2.4bn shares worth RM2.66bn.\nThe local benchmark index is expected to extend its profit-taking consolidation phase, as market sentiment should remain subdued while investors await crucial domestic and U.S. data releases ahead of the weekend. The final GDP data for Malaysia's 2Q25 is scheduled to be released today apart from US retail sales, IPI, University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, etc. Immediate support remains at the 50%FR (1,527) with stronger supports seen at the 38.2%FR (1,490) and the 23.6%FR (1,444).

    "content": "Cautious Trading Ahead of Major Data Releases\nThe local market dipped on Thursday, as profit-taking emerged following the recent uptrend, with losses led by the transportation, technology, and consumer products sectors. The FBM KLCI dropped 5.55 points to close at 1,581.05, off an early high of 1,595.31 and low of 1,575.79, as losers crowded gainers 611 to 404, on lower turnover of 2.4bn shares worth RM2.66bn.\nKey Supports at 1,527/1,490; Resistance at 1,610/1,644\nThe local benchmark index is expected to extend its profit-taking consolidation phase, as market sentiment should remain subdued while investors await crucial domestic and U.S. data releases ahead of the weekend. The final GDP data for Malaysia's 2Q25 is scheduled to be released today apart from US retail sales, IPI, University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, etc. Immediate support remains at the 50%FR (1,527) with stronger supports seen at the 38.2%FR (1,490) and the 23.6%FR (1,444). Immediate resistance stays at 1,610, the 76.4%FR, with next upside hurdle at the December 2024 high of 1,644, followed by stronger resistance at 1,684.\nBargain CelcomDigi and Wasco\nCelcomDigi shares remain in a base building phase, with key supports from the 50%FR (RM3.70) and 38.2%FR (RM3.57) cushioning downside, while immediate resistance levels are seen at the 76.4%FR (RM3.99) and RM4.13 going forward.

Crucial support comes from 88sen and the 09/04/25 low (78sen).\nAsian Markets Slip Ahead of Fresh U.S. Economic Data\nMost Asian stocks declined on Thursday as traders awaited fresh U.S. economic data and looked ahead to the anticipated Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska. Traders are awaiting U.S. producer price inflation data later in the day, followed by the retail sales report on Friday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants the Fed to keep the door open to a larger 50 basis points rate cut next month following recent weak US jobs data. Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions remained on edge after the Trump threatened \"severe consequences\" if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine. Trump did not specify what the consequences could be but he has warned of economic sanctions if the meeting in Alaska on Friday proves fruitless.\nOn economic front. Australia’s unemployment rate eased to 4.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis in July, in line with estimates of economists polled by Reuters. The reading was lower than the 4.3% recorded in June, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.53% to 8,873.80, while South Korea’s Kospi closed almost unchanged at 3,225.66. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.45% to 42,649.26 and the Topix fell 1.10% to 3,057.95. In the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.46% to 3,666.44, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.37% to 25,519.32.\nWall Street Flat as Traders Digest Hot Inflation Data\nWall Street's major indexes ended largely flat overnight as traders absorbed a hotter-thanexpected Producer Price Index report, dampening hopes for a substantial interest rate cut in September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down by 0.02% to finish at 44,911.26. The S&P 500 inched higher 0.03% to 6,468.54, while the Nasdaq Composite closed nearly unchanged at 21,710.67. The weakness on Wall Street came following the release of a Labor Department report showing producer prices increased 0.9% last month, the most in three years due to a surge in the costs of goods and services, suggesting a broad pickup in inflation was imminent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI to rise 0.2%. In the 12 months through July, the PPI increased 3.3% after advancing 2.4% in June.\nThe Labor Department also released a separate report unexpectedly showing a modest decrease by first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended August 9th. Despite the higher inflation number, fed funds futures have priced in about 93% odds of a rate cut in September, only slightly lower from the day prior, according to the CME’s Fed Watch tool. Late Friday’s retail sales reading will serve as this week's final key economic data point.\nCorporate\nChin Hin Group Property Bhd (Not Rated)is disposing of its entire equity interest in four subsidiaries involved in the commercial vehicles and bodyworks segment to N&K Resources (M) Sdn Bhd for RM74mn.

(The Edge)\nEconomy\nBank Negara governor warns of structural shifts reshaping global monetary system\nBank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has cautioned that major structural changes are reshaping the global monetary and financial system, urging the need for quick adaptation to avoid being exposed to new and emerging risks. BNM governor Datuk Seri Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said traditional roles of central banks are under growing pressure from challenges such as global economic fragmentation, climate change, and the rapid digitalisation of finance. “We gather at a time of great transformation in the global monetary and financial system, where long-standing boundaries of central bank mandates are being tested by unprecedented structural shifts,” Abdul Rasheed said during the launch of the Tun Ismail Ali Centre of Excellence (Tiacoe) at the Asia School of Business (ASB) here on Thursday.

Deputy Minister Datuk Chan Foong Hin said the special approvals aim to address labour shortages and boost national productivity and output. “To tackle the shortage, the government has granted special quota approvals for foreign worker recruitment in the plantation sector on a case-by-case basis,” he told the Dewan Rakyat during question-and-answer time on Thursday. He was responding to Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham (Pakatan Harapan-Beruas), who had asked about the workforce needs in the plantation sector, particularly in oil palm and rubber, and the quotas given to address the shortfall. Chan said Immigration Department statistics as of June 30 this year showed there were 258,153 active Temporary Employment Visit Pass (PLKS) holders in the plantation sector. (The Edge, Bernama)\nGovt Estimates 4% of MSMEs to be Involved in E-invoicing\nThe government estimated that 4% of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) would be involved in the implementation of e-invoicing following mandatory compliance from July 1, 2025.

Key deliverables from the consultant will include recommendations for a strategic plan, implementation schedule, action plan, and timeline, while ensuring acceptance and support from all key stakeholders, Loke added. (The Edge)\nChina to Send Top Envoy to India as Ties Warm After US Tariffs\nChina will send a top official to New Delhi next week, as Beijing steps up efforts to ease long-standing tensions with India amid US President Donald Trump’s global trade overhaul. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will likely travel to New Delhi on Aug 18 — his first trip to the country in over three years — and is expected to meet India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, according to people familiar with the matter. A key agenda item will be discussing ways to reduce troop levels along the disputed Himalayan border, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are still private. Such a step would mark significant progress toward restoring trust between the two countries, they added. The trip marks the latest step in a slow but steady thaw between the Asian neighbours, who are also holding talks to restart border trade and plan to resume direct flights as early as next month. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit China in August — his first trip there in seven years. (Bloomberg)\nS&P Lifts India's Rating to BBB in First Upgrade Since 2007\nS&P Global Ratings on Thursday upgraded India's long-term sovereign credit rating to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', the first upgrade in 18 years, citing strong economic growth, improved monetary policy credibility, and sustained fiscal consolidation. Fitch has rated India at 'BBB-' since 2006 while Moody's has had a 'Baa3' rating in place since June 2020. The upgrade follows S&P's decision in May 2024 to revise India's outlook to positive from stable, driven by robust growth and better quality of government spending. S&P said it expects the impact of US tariffs on the Indian economy to be manageable due to its limited reliance on trade and the dominance of domestic demand in its economy. India faces the prospect of a 50% tariff on exports to the US after President Donald Trump doubled the levy citing New Delhi's oil purchases from Russia, which numerous other countries have imposed sanctions on after its invasion of Ukraine. (Reuters)\nVietnam Makes First US Oil Purchase in 2025, Sources Say\nVietnam's Binh Son Refining and Petrochemica (BSR) has bought one million barrels of US West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery, the country's first US oil purchase in 2025, sources said on Thursday. BSR bought the light-sweet crude from Mercuria, the sources said. It typically processes domestic crude. A board member of BSR declined to comment on the deal when reached by Reuters. The company did not immediately respond to an email request. In deals negotiated with Washington to avoid high US tariffs and reduce trade surpluses with the United States, Vietnam and other countries such as Indonesia and Thailand have committed to buy more US crude. (Reuters)\nUS Producer Prices Rise by Most in Three Years on Services\nUS wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, boosted by a surge in margins that indicates companies are not absorbing higher import costs related to tariffs. The producer price index increased 0.9% from a month earlier after no change in June, according to a Bureau of Labour Statistics report out Thursday. The measure rose 3.3% from a year ago. Services costs increased 1.1% — the most since March 2022. Within services, margins at wholesalers and retailers jumped 2%, led by machinery and equipment wholesaling. Goods prices excluding food and energy rose 0.4%. The report indicates companies are adjusting their pricing of goods and services to help offset costs associated with higher US tariffs, despite the softening of demand in the first half of the year. (Bloomberg)\nUS Jobless Claims Edge Lower, Continuing Claims Remain Elevated\nApplications for US unemployment benefits edged lower last week, suggesting employers remain reluctant to lay off workers. Initial claims decreased by 3,000 to 224,000 in the week ended Aug 9, which was about in line with economists’ forecasts. Businesses have pared back on hiring new employees amid economic uncertainty driven by President Donald Trump’s policies, particularly tariffs. However, the relatively low level of initial filings indicates that employers aren’t widely cutting workers. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, fell to 1.95mn in the previous week, according to Labour Department data released Thursday. That figure has been hovering around the highest since 2021 for the last few months, indicating many out-of-work Americans are finding it difficult to find employment. (Bloomberg)\nTrump signals he will announce Fed chair pick to succeed Powell ‘a little bit early’\nUS President Donald Trump said he may name the next Federal Reserve (Fed) chair “a little bit early” and added that he is down to three or four potential candidates as he looks for a successor to Jerome Powell. “I will be naming a new chairman sometime within the next — I think I will name it a little bit early, the new chairman. I am down to three or four names,” Trump said during an event at the Kennedy Center in Washington, describing the contenders as “all good, all great”. Trump has hammered Powell over the central bank’s decision to hold interest rates steady, repeatedly calling in the past for him to resign and publicly mulling whether he should fire the chair outright before saying he would wait for his term to end in May. Naming his successor while Powell is still finishing his term raises the prospect of a “shadow Fed” emerging and risks creating whiplash for investors tracking the positions of both the current and future chairs. (Bloomberg)\nUK Economy Grows by Stronger-than-expected 0.3% in 2Q\nBritain's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025 after growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, offering a boost to finance minister Rachel Reeves, official figures showed on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters, as well as the Bank of England, had forecast 0.1% growth in gross domestic product for the April-June period. Thursday's data from the Office for National Statistics showed British GDP rose by 0.4% in June alone after a 0.1% fall in output in May due to surprisingly strong growth across services, industrial output and construction. Output in the second quarter overall was up 1.2% from the same period last year compared to a median forecast from economists for 1.0% growth. Sterling rose slightly against the dollar after the data. (Reuters)\nSource:TA Research- 15 Aug 2025",

Initial jobless claims also unexpectedly fell to 224k for the first week of July (consensus: 228k; 227k), while outstanding claims also eased from the prior three-year high. Both data combined underscores softening, but still robust labour market conditions, which may continue to perpetuate inflation risks ahead. This comes as Atlanta Fed President Bostic also chimed in that the Fed can afford to defer policy rate adjustment amid near-full US employment, while Chicago Fed President Goolsbee said the upcoming September meeting will be 'live' for interpreting mixed economic data and the best interest rate response.

There was profit taking on AAA rated BSN IMTN 02/29 at 3.53%, up 1 bps.\nCommodities Crude oilprices (+1.8%) reversed earlier losses, ahead of today's Trump-Putin summit.

We believe the market is still anticipating easing trade tensions, which could lift the market sentiment going forward. Meanwhile, UNH jumped post-market after Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake, despite concerns over ongoing lawsuits. In the semiconductor space, Intel’s share price jumped +8% after reports that the US government plans to take a stake in the company. In the commodities market, Brent oil rebounded towards USD66/bbl, while both gold and CPO retreated to USD3,333/oz and RM4,407/MT, respectively.\nMY: Tracking Wall Street’s mixed performance, we expect further profit-taking activities to emerge on the local bourse. However, traders may shift their attention to Plantation stocks like JPG, which posted +50% YoY growth in its bottom-line. Besides, we believe the overall data center theme will continue to support the Construction, M&E and Utility segments in the near term; with the latter also being boosted by the government’s NETR initiative. While the technology sector has pulled back, we expect the Apple’s USD100bn investment pledge could provide support for stocks like UNISEM, INARI, and FRONTKN.\nStocks to watch:\nUtility: KJTS, *PEKAT*Construction: GDB, *JTGROUP*Automotive: *BETA*Building Material: *PMETAL*Technology: *MCLEAN*Property: ECOWLDPlantation: JPGFinance: OSK\nSource: M+ Global\nDisclaimer\nThe content published is solely for information and personal use only.

    "content": "HEADLINES\nEconomy\nUS: Producer inflation heats up as goods, services pricessoar.The stronger-than-expected producer inflation report from the Labor Department followed data this week showing consumers paid higher prices for services like dental care and airline fares last month. There were also no signs of further labour market deterioration in early August. Economists had hoped that moderate services price gains would blunt the inflationary impact of higher goods prices from sweeping import tariffs. The producer price index for final demand jumped 0.9% last month, the largest advance since June 2022, after being unchanged in June, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 0.2%. The US central bank puts more emphasis on services inflation given the economy is services-driven. Though financial markets continued to anticipate the Fed would resume rate cuts in Sept, some economists urged caution. (Reuters)\nUS: Government to shed 300,000 workers this year, Trump's HR chief forecasts, which would amount to a 12.5% decrease in the federal workforce since January. Office of Personnel Management director Scott Kupor said 80% of those workers would leave voluntarily and only 20% would be fired. It amounts to nearly a doubling of the 154,000 workers that Reuters reported had taken buyouts last month. Upon taking office in Jan, President Donald Trump launched a massive campaign to downsize the 2.4m strong federal civilian workforce, which he says is bloated and inefficient. \"I cannot force people to lay people off,\" Kupor said in an interview in Washington. He said he would have to persuade cabinet secretaries to buy into his vision of government efficiency. (Reuters)\nEU: Industry shrinks more than feared in June but GDP holds up.Industrial output fell 1.3% on the month in June, driven by a big dip in Germany and weak consumer goods production, underperforming expectations for a 1.0% fall, data from Eurostat showed. Eurostat also revised its output growth estimate for May to 1.1% from 1.7%, suggesting that the underlying trend is weaker than thought. Meanwhile GDP grew by 0.1% on the quarter, in line with a preliminary estimate, and employment rose just 0.1% on the quarter, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll, but below the 0.2% in the previous three months. Still, investors continue to bet on a modest upturn on the premise that a recent EU trade deal with the US. provides much needed certainty and Germany's plans to sharply boost budget spending will support growth. This is why financial investors think the ECB may be done cutting interest rates and policymakers will sit out a temporary dip in inflation below the 2% target, as price pressures over the medium term are already building up. (Reuters)\nUK: Economy grows 0.3% in second quarter.The UK economy expanded 0.3% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations but underlining the challenge facing chancellor Rachel Reeves as she attempts to boost growth and repair the public finances. The figures followed a quarter in which businesses contended with higher taxes announced in Reeves' October Budget and the uncertainty unleashed by Donald Trump's trade war. The economy's performance in the first quarter was helped by a surge in exports to the US ahead of the imposition of tariffs. The GDP figure for the April-to-June period was above the 0.1% forecast by economists but marked a sharp slowdown from the 0.7% expansion in the first quarter. The chancellor is gearing up for an Autumn Budget that economists say will require further tax increases to fill a fiscal hole that some estimate could exceed GBP20bn. (Financial Times)\nJapan: Bessent says BOJ is 'behind the curve' on inflation,likely to hike rates.The Bank of Japan will likely be raising interest rates as it is behind the curve in dealing with the risk of inflation, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television, in his most explicit comment on Japan's monetary policy. The remarks contrast with those of BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has repeatedly brushed aside the view the central bank was being too slow in raising rates and could be late in forestalling too-high inflation. Bessent said US Treasury yields are feeling the impact of overseas developments, with the 30-year yield getting dragged up by rising long-term bond yields in Japan and Germany. \"There's definitely leakage from the Japanese have an inflation problem,\" Bessent said in the interview with Bloomberg Television Bessent mentioned that he had spoken with BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda. (Reuters)\nIndia: Wants US ties based on mutual respect, says its arms purchases are on course, seeking to temper worries that ties were headed downhill in the aftermath of high tariffs imposed by Washington. A US defence policy team will be in New Delhi this month for talks with Indian officials and its arms purchases from the US are on course despite the strain in ties, the Indian foreign ministry said. A new friendship built between the two countries has hit a rough patch after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% last week from an earlier 25% saying it was a penalty for India's continued imports of Russian oil. New Delhi has accused the US of double standards in singling it out for Russian oil imports and called the tariffs unfair, unjustified and unreasonable. (Reuters)\nMarkets\nSime Darby Property (Neutral, TP: RM1.40): Seeks loan tobuild Malaysian data centre for Google. Sime Darby Property is in talks with banks for a loan of as much as RM3bn (USD714m) to fund the building of a data centre that will be leased to Google, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed loan will have a tenure of five years and carry an extension option of as long as two years, the people said. Discussions are ongoing and details could change, they added. Sime Darby Property didn't respond to a request for comment. (Bloomberg)\nChin Hin: Selling stakes in firms for RM74m. Chin Hin Group Property is disposing of its stakes in four companies to N&K Resources (M) SB for RM74m, to focus on its core business of property development. Chin Hin said it is disposing of its entire equity interest in Boon Koon Vehicles Industries SB, BKCV SB, Boon Koon Fleet Management SB and BK Fleet Management SB - all of which undertake the company's commercial vehicles and bodyworks business. Upon completion of the proposed disposals, Chin Hin said it will no longer be involved in the commercial vehicles and bodyworks businesses and that the financials (of the four disposed of companies) will be de-consolidated from Chin Hin and its subsidiaries. (StarBiz)\nAemulus: Acquires Chinese group's camera sensor testingbusiness for RM19m.Aemulus Holdings entered into a deal to acquire the camera sensor testing business of China-based Revotronix group for CNY32.46m (RM19.1m). Aemulus said the deal, undertaken by its wholly owned subsidiaries Tangming Shengshi Technology Precision Instrument (Suzhou) Co Ltd (TMSS) and Aemulus Corporation SB, covers the transfer of intellectual property, technology roadmap, customer and supplier relationships, sales contracts, selected employees, inventories and fixed assets. Revotronix, which develops and sells semiconductor and electronic equipment for CMOS image sensors (CIS) in China, has partnered with TMSS since 2021, said Aemulus, adding that the acquisition will give TMSS direct access to one of the world's largest CIS makers. (The Edge)\nCatcha Digital: To buy 60% stake in event.Catcha Digital said it is buying a 60% stake in a trade show organiser for RM11.4m cash. The proposed acquisition of One International Exhibition SB, which caters to a distinct client base through agriculture and construction events, will complement its existing subsidiary that also holds exhibitions, Catcha Digital said. \"This complementary expansion enables the Catcha Digital Group to tap into new industry verticals and client segments, thereby strengthening its overall value proposition within the digital media and event management space,\" the company noted. (The Edge)\nCuckoo International: Reports small fall in 2Q profit, upbeat onlong-term prospects.Cuckoo International (MAL) posted a 1.83% fall in second quarter net profit versus the first quarter, dragged down by listing expenses of RM4.7m and higher net impairment losses on financial instruments. Its net profit for 2QFY2025 totalled RM27.4m, compared with RM27.9m in 1QFY2025. Revenue, however, rose 3.51% to RM306.7m from RM296.3m, mainly boosted by stronger contributions from the CUCKOO co-created segment. The CUCKOO branded segment contributed 78.5% of total revenue during the quarter, while the CUCKOO co-created segment accounted for 21.3%. (The Edge)\nMARKET UPDATE\nThe KLCI might open lower today as most stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday after a disappointing report said inflation was worse last month at the US wholesale level than economists expected. But gains for Amazon and some other influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses. Seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1% to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped by less than 0.1% from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3% last month at the US wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5% rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for US shoppers as it makes its way through the system. The data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. Thursday's disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That's a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find. But a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term. In stock markets elsewhere, indices were mixed across Asia and Europe ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. Back home, the KLCI lost 5.55 points or 0.35% to 1581.05.\nSource:PublicInvest Research- 15 Aug 2025",
