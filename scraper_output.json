    "content": "Keep BUY, new MYR1.37 TP (SOP) from MYR1.58, 86% upside and 6% yield.1H25 results came in below expectations, mainly on weaker performances in the industrial and food segments. We still anticipate earnings to improve in 2H, underpinned by ongoing volume recovery, contributions from new business initiatives, and seasonally stronger demand - all of which should support operating leverage. Texchem Resources' current 6x P/E valuation appears undemanding, and has yet to reflect its recovery prospects.\nBelow expectations.1H25 core earnings came in at MYR4.3m vs 1H24's -MYR0.4m, meeting 26% of our full-year forecast. The shortfall was mainly on softer-than-expected performances in the industrial and food divisions. Note: We adjusted for unrealised FX losses of MYR2.2m to derive our core earnings.\nResults review.YoY, 1H25 revenue dipped 0.6% to MYR566.8m, mainly on weaker performances in the industrial segment (-6.9%) from price dumping by China, and the food division (-11.1%) amid softer global fishmeal prices. That said, 1H25 EBITDA margins expanded 1.7ppts to 8.5%, supported by stronger contributions from polymer engineering and the improving-margin restaurant division. QoQ, 2Q25 revenue rose 0.7% to MYR284.4m, driven by continued recovery in polymer engineering (+5.1%) and seasonally stronger sales in the restaurant segment (+6.8%). However, 2Q25 core profit fell 7.9% QoQ to MYR2.1m, mainly dragged by challenging operating conditions in Myanmar, which affected the food division.\nOutlook.The polymer engineering business is expected to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the hard disk drive or HDD and semiconductor industries, with continued growth from medical life science customers. Several new high-margin projects are gaining traction, and more are in the pipeline - supporting margin improvements and operating leverage, in our view. For the restaurant wing, management is looking to refresh the menu and expand into suburban locations, which tends to deliver stronger margins. Additionally, the appreciation of the MYR should help ease raw material costs. Meanwhile, the industrial segment continues to grapple with weaker demand due to price dumping from China - an external pressure that remains difficult to counter. The food division has diversified its supply chain to Thailand since FY24 to manage the impact of FX controls, and management remains hopeful on gradual easing of those restrictions.\nForecast and ratings.We revise down our FY25F-27F earnings by 14%, 5%, and 5% after lowering our margin assumptions for the industrial and food segments. Consequently, we lower our TP to MYR1.37 (inclusive of a 0% ESG premium/discount), which implies a blended 11.2x FY25F P/E. Key risks: Weaker-than-expected sales/orders and fluctuations in chemical prices.\nSource:RHB Research- 25 Jul 2025",

    "content": "Upgrade to BUY from Neutral, TP rises to MYR95 from MYR77, 15% upside with 3% FY26F yield.Nestle (M)'s 1H25 results are above expectations as we expect its recovery to pick up ahead, spurred by margin expansion. This, together with the demand normalisation stemming from improving sentiment on its brands, leads us to believe that its prospects may have turned the corner. We upgrade our call to BUY, as we think its comeback is timely in view of the pick-up in investor appetite for defensive stocks amidst uncertain market conditions.\n1HFY25 results are above expectations.NESZ's 1H25 core net profit of MYR284m (-5% YoY) comprises 54-60% of our and Street full-year forecasts due to strong sales traction. We also expect a margin recovery ahead, on easing commodity prices. Post results, we raise FY25-27F earnings by 8%, 7%, 3% after imputing higher sales growth and GPM assumptions. We also revise our DCF risk assumptions to factor in the demand recovery. Correspondingly, our DCF-derived TP rises to MYR95 (inclusive of an 8% ESG premium), which implies 34x P/E FY26F, below the stock's 5-year mean.\nResults review.YoY, 1H25 revenue grew 4% to MYR3.4bn, driven by robust export sales and a gradual domestic market recovery. 1H25 GPM slipped 1ppt to 30.4%, reflecting the persistent cost pressures from elevated commodity prices - but there are showing signs of easing, as evidenced by YoY improvement in 2Q25 GPM. With 1H25 opex rising in tandem with the topline, 1H25 core net profit slid 5% YoY to MYR284m. QoQ, 2Q25 revenue was 6% lower due to the softer seasonality, with 1Q25 boosted by the Lunar New Year andAidil Fitrifestival season. Correspondingly, core net profit fell 24% QoQ to MYR123m on lower GPM and an unfavourable swing in marketing expenses. A first DPS of 70 sen was declared (1H24: 70 sen).\nThe worst could be over.We take comfort from the return of topline growth and believe it is sustainable, premised on NESZ's effective marketing engagements to stimulate consumer spending and the normalising sentiment on Nestle brands. On top of that, the fall in key commodity prices including that of coffee, cocoa, wheat and sugar (Figures 2-5) should propel a margin recovery as early as 2H25, further aided by a stronger MYR. Meanwhile, consumption of staple food products should remain resilient, underpinned by wage growth and continuous fiscal support extended to the lower income groups. This, together with the group's quality product offering and entrenched distribution channels, will provide earnings visibility - notwithstanding the challenging business environment and uncertain economic outlook.\nRisks to our recommendationinclude sharp spikes in commodity prices and a weaker-than-expected market share.\nSource:RHB Research- 25 Jul 2025",

    "content": "Initiating coverage with a BUY and MYR1.51 TP, 15% upside and 2% FY26F (May) yield.The nascent dollar store industry will continue to prosper as penetration rates pick up to meet rising demand. This retail model offers a comprehensive range of value-for-money products that appeal to increasingly cost-conscious consumers amidst rising living costs. As the dominant market leader, Eco-Shop Marketing is aiming to capture untapped market opportunities, focusing on outlet expansion, driving robust SSSG, developing house brands, and continuously refining operational efficiency metrics.\nBeneficiary of Malaysia's macroeconomic tailwinds.According to Frost and Sullivan, the dollar store industry will grow at a 2024E-2029F CAGR of 14%, outpacing the 6% of overall store-based retail sales. This suggests a switch in consumer preference towards the dollar store format given the inflationary environment, thanks to the affordability advantage of the flat-price model. In addition, the relatively faster income growth within the lower-income groups ie the bulk of the customers has also accelerated the shift. That said, the penetration rate of dollar stores in Malaysia still significantly lags behind that of mature markets - indicating the ample headroom for expansion.\nAggressive network growth to drive penetration.ECOSHOP's ambitious expansion plans entail the opening of at least 70 net new stores pa, supported by raising of distribution throughput capacity. The mushrooming store network will allow the group to capitalise on the rapid industry growth and the resultant growing operational scale will raise the barrier of entry, thereby fortifying its market position. Consequently, its entrenched fundamentals in insourced distribution capabilities, differentiated merchandising strategies and crowd-pulling house brands will be further enhanced to drive sustainable profitability through improving operating leverage whilst maintaining the ultra-affordable price points.\nForecasts and valuation.We forecast a 3-year earnings CAGR of 18% for ECOSHOP, underpinned by store expansion, robust SSSG and growing economies of scale. Our DCF-derived TP of MYR1.51 (inclusive of a 4% ESG premium) implies a 2026F P/E of 31x is between the implied valuations of 99 Speed Mart Retail Holdings (99SMART MK, BUY, TP: MYR2.45) and Mr DIY Group (MRDIY MK, BUY, TP: MYR1.87). We believe the rich premium valuation is warranted and justifiable by: i) Consumer sector's resilient appeal under the current market environment, ii) its position to capitalise on consumer downtrading trends, and iii) growth potential of the nascent dollar industry.\nRisks to our recommendation includemajor delays in expansion plans, FX fluctuations and a sharp rise in input costs.\n\nSource:RHB Research- 25 Jul 2025",

    "content": "NORTHEAST GROUP(NE | 0325)\nLast Price: RM0.64 | Technical Call:BUY\n\n\nCompany Profile.Northeast Group (Northeast) is a precision engineering manufacturer serving the photonics, electrical & electronics (E&E), semiconductor, telecommunications, and optoelectronics industries. It produces high-precision components machined to exact specifications for further processing or assembly into clients’ end products. The group also provides value-added services such as surface finishing, sheet metal fabrication, and mechanical sub-assembly. Northeast operates three factories in Penang, Malaysia, supporting clients both locally and internationally, including in the USA, UK, Thailand, and Singapore.\nGrowth Strategies.(i) Positioned to capitalise on structural tailwinds by strengthening production capabilities and leveraging precision engineering expertise to meet rising demand across high-growth sectors such as photonics, semiconductors, and telecommunications—fuelled by digitalisation, AI adoption, and the expansion of data infrastructure. (ii) Expanding production capacity with a new factory and warehouse, targeted for completion by 2029, to support increasingly complex, high-mix precision engineering output. These investments aim to deepen support for existing clients while building capacity to serve new local and international clients. (iii) Driving business growth through additional order wins and the continued expansion of the client base.\nFinancial Performance.In 2QFY25, Northeast recorded higher revenue of RM27.4mil (+13.5% QoQ) and a PAT of RM6.1mil (+21x QoQ), driven primarily by stronger sales contributions from the semiconductor and optoelectronic industries, as well as the absence of one-off listing expenses of approximately RM3.7mil incurred in 1QFY25.\nValuation.Northeast is trading at an FY26F P/E of 18x, below the Bursa Industrial Production Index’s 22x. In comparison, UWC— an integrated engineering support services provider offering a comprehensive range of metal fabrication processes such as laser cutting, punching, bending, welding, milling, turning, and painting—trades at a higher FY26F P/E of 25.4x.\nTechnical Analysis.We expect further upside for Northeast after it broke above the RM0.60 resistance with a long bullish candle a few sessions ago. With the 20-day EMA remaining above the 50-day EMA since the bullish crossover in early June, the uptrend may continue in the near term. A bullish bias may emerge above the RM0.60 level, with stop-loss set at RM0.55, below the 20-day EMA. Towards the upside, near-term resistance level is seen at RM0.74, followed by RM0.80.\nEntry:RM0.60-0.64\nTarget:RM0.74, RM0.80\nExit:RM0.55\nSource:AmInvest Research- 25 Jul 2025",

Alphabet beat estimates and raised its AI capex to USD85bn, while Tesla missed earnings and flagged rough quarters ahead. Both S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced by 0.1% and 0.2%, while the Dow retreated by 0.7%.\nThe Day Ahead\nUS:Optimism over a potential US-EU trade deal capping tariffs at 15% has pushed Wall Street into new highs. On corporate earnings, Alphabet beat 2Q25 revenue and EPS estimates, raising its AI capex to USD85bn, while Tesla missed expectations, with Musk warning of a few tough quarters ahead. Meanwhile, on the economic front, jobless claims remained lower than expected, signalling labour market resilience. Given the mixed corporate earnings and economic data, coupled with the overstretched market conditions, the market may warrant a slight pullback. In the commodities market, Brent crude, Gold and CPO traded at USD69/bbl, USD3,368/oz and RM4,330/MT respectively.\nMY:Selectively, we are noticing uptrend formation within several sectors that are related to utilities and data center. Also, we opine that investors can start accumulating banking stocks for long-term positions despite the recent OPR cut as Bursa Finance Index has declined around 10% from the YTD high. Valuations remain attractive, with the sector trading at 10x PE and 1.1x PB vs. its 10-year average of 12.3x and 1.2x, respectively. We favour MAYBANK, AMMB and RHBBANK attractive dividend yields. Meanwhile, the RM100 cash handouts and price caps on tolls and RON95 are expected to spur short-term consumer spending, benefiting companies like 99SMART, ECOSHOP, and MRDIY.\nFBMKLCI Technical Outlook\n\nThe local bourse closed above the MA lines, with technical indicators showing positive signals.

    "content": "Maintain NEUTRAL with an unchanged TP of RM77.90.Nestlé’s 2QFY25 results were within our expectations but above consensus, underpinned by strong topline recovery and a prudent pricing strategy amidst elevated cost pressures. We make no changes to our earnings forecasts as the results align with expectations. Our TP remains unchanged at RM77.90, based on DDM valuation with a consistent 3.2% growth and an unchanged WACC of 6.7%.\nWithin expectations.Nestlé chalked in 2QFY25 revenue of RM1.67b (+9.5%yoy; -5.6%qoq) and core PATAMI of RM111.4m (+33.0%yoy; - 37.2%qoq) which brought 1HFY25 core PATANCI to RM288.8m (- 4.8%yoy). This accounted for 53% of our FY25F forecast, in line with expectations, but came in above consensus at 61%. An interim dividend of 70 sen per share was announced for 1HFY25, unchanged from 2QFY24.\nSteady 1H Revenue.Nestlé recorded a 4.0%yoy increase in 1HFY25 revenue to RM3.44b, underpinned by strong festive-driven demand during Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Aidilfitri in 1QFY25. As expected, revenue normalised by -5.6%qoq in 2QFY25 following the seasonal peak but remained higher on a year-on-year basis by +9.5%yoy. Domestic sales registered positive growth, supported by sustained brand strength, effective pricing execution, and the successful rollout of new product innovations. Export sales also held firm, leveraging Nestlé Malaysia’s role as the Group’s largest global Halal manufacturing hub.\nMargin Resilience Amid Cost Challenges.Nestlé maintained a relatively stable gross profit margin of 30.4% in 1HFY25 (1HFY24: 31.4%), supported by ongoing cost optimisation efforts amid continued volatility in key commodity inputs, particularly cocoa and coffee. Operating profit margin moderated slightly by 1.2ppts yoy to 11.5%, reflecting higher commercial and marketing investments to support brand visibility and product innovation. Consequently, core PATAMI for 1HFY25 declined -4.8%yoy, as margin pressures were partially mitigated by operational efficiencies and a prudent pricing strategy, helping to preserve overall profitability in a cost-sensitive environment.\nOutlook.We expect topline momentum to remain steady in 2HFY25, supported by resilient consumer demand, strong brand equity, and continued product innovation. Nestlé is gradually recovering from the boycott-related revenue decline and elevated input cost base seen in 2024. The recent correction in coffee prices and stronger MYR may ease cost pressure, although cocoa remains elevated. While ongoing brand investments may limit short-term margin expansion, they are crucial for restoring consumer loyalty and sustaining long-term competitiveness. We stay cautious but acknowledge Nestlé’s structural strength and recovery potential.\nSource:MIDF Research- 25 Jul 2025",

    "content": "Stronger front-end outlook driven by better yields and expanding capabilities\nBack-end and life science segments face policy risk, but upside seen from new models and customer relocation\nMaintain BUY with an unchanged TP of RM2.60\nFE activities gaining momentum\nUWC's front-end outlook remains positive, supported by rising yields, expanding capabilities, and firm demand. Management shared that production yield has improved to 65% (from 60% in 3QFY25) and is now sustainable without external consultancy support, which previously cost US$1m/quarter (RM4.2m at US$1:RM4.20). The cost savings are expected to be reflected from 1QFY26 onwards. The group recently added four 5-axis CNC machines to enhance its fabrication capabilities, allowing to meet more complex FE requirements. Overall demand remains healthy, with increased loading expected over the next 2 months. Its largest FE customer is projected to contribute 30-35% of group revenue and remain the key growth driver in FY26. The ground floor of Building 6 is currently occupied for chamber production, with the customer expected to fully take up the entire facility.\nNew models and customer relocation could drive a better BE outlook\nTariff risks weigh more heavily on the BE segment, given its 20% exports exposure to the US, which has led to delivery deferrals amid ongoing trade discussions. While the outlook from its largest BE customer remains subdued, the anticipated relocation of operations is expected to spur incremental demand from higher test requirements. Separately, UWC's weekly test handler orders from another customer have increased from 6 units in Apr25 to 8 units in Jul25, with management expecting new model introductions to further lift volumes to 10-12 units over the next 2 months. We expect the incremental revenue contributions to materialise in 1HFY26, with both BE customers accounting for a combined 30% of the total group's revenue in FY26.\nMaintain BUY and TP of RM2.60\nWe maintain our earnings forecast, BUY rating, and 12-month TP of RM2.60, based on a target PE multiple on FY26E EPS. We remain optimistic on the group's prospects in tandem with improved execution, deeper technical capabilities, and robust order flows. Key downside risks: prolonged semiconductor sector downturn, continued order delay by its key customers, weaker US$ against RM, and softer-than-expected margins.\nSource:Phillip Capital Research- 25 Jul 2025",

This translates to an attractive dividend yield of 8.0% based on the last closing price.\nFY25 revenue rose 33.3% YoY to RM136.1mn, driven by stronger contributions from its seven existing KIP Malls and incremental income from the newly acquired DPulze Shopping Centre, TF Value Mart and Cheras Jaya industrial property.\nDespite the robust topline growth, realised net profit increased at a slower pace of 14.6% to RM51.6mn due to a 64.5% YoY surge in operating expenses, alongside significantly higher manager’s management fee (+113.7% YoY) and borrowing costs (+49.4% YoY).\nOn a sequential basis, 4QFY25 realised net profit grew 5.8% QoQ to RM15.2mn, primarily benefiting from the full-quarter contribution of newly acquired Cheras Jaya Industrial property.\nImpact\nWe maintain our earnings forecasts for now, pending further insights from the analyst briefing scheduled later today.\nOutlook\nManagement remains upbeat about KIP REIT’s outlook, underpinned by the solid performance of its existing property portfolio, proactive leasing strategies, and continuous operational improvements.\nThe REIT continues to prioritise prudent capital management and sustainable returns to unitholders. Looking ahead, its focus on acquiring yield-accretive assets and expanding exposure in both the retail and industrial segments positions KIP REIT well for long-term value creation and to capitalise on emerging opportunities.\nValuation\nWe maintain ourBuyrecommendation on KIP REIT with an unchangedTPofRM1.17/unit, based on a target yield of 6.75%.\nSource:TA Research- 25 Jul 2025",

    "content": "Review\nNestlé (Malaysia) Berhad’s (Nestlé) 2QFY25 results were in line with expectations, with 1HFY25 core earnings of RM251.0mn accounting for 54% of our full-year estimate and 53% of consensus’ forecasts.\n2QFY25 core net profit surged 19.8% YoY to RM112.1mn, outpacing the 9.5% YoY revenue growth to RM1.7bn. The solid performance was driven by: i) an estimated 5-6% price hike on targeted products such as Milo, Nescafe, and Maggi Tomato Ketchup; and ii) effective cost optimisation initiatives.\nCumulatively, 1HFY25 revenue rose 4.0% YoY to RM3.4bn, mainly driven by stronger sales in 2Q. Despite the higher sales, core net profit declined 13.1% YoY after excluding one-off items. The weaker performance was mainly due to: i) rising cost pressures amid cautious cost pass-through to consumers in 1H, and ii) geopolitical uncertainties.\nThe group declared an interim dividend of RM0.70/share for the quarter under review, consistent with the payout in 2QFY24.\nImpact\nNo changes to our earnings estimate at this juncture, pending further guidance on the group’s 2H outlook from today’s analyst briefing.\nOutlook\nKey commodities demonstrated favourable pricing trends in 1H25, which are expected to support the group’s profitability in the near term.\nCombined with effective procurement strategies and strengthened cost controls, we believe Nestlé is on track to deliver improved profitability in FY25, rebounding from the trough in FY24.\nValuation\nWe maintain our TP atRM100.80/share, based on a DDM valuation (k: 6.4%; g: 3.0%) and 5% ESG premium.

Kossan shares are poised for recovery, with a confirmed breakout above the 23.6%FR (RM1.52) and 38.2%FR (RM1.78) to enhance upside momentum towards the 50%FR (RM1.99) ahead, while strong retracement supports are seen at the 08/05/23 low (RM1.11) and 89sen.\nNews Bites\nMalaysia has secured over RM63bn worth of semiconductor investments under its National Semiconductor Strategy as of March 2025, less than a year after its launch in May 2024.\nThe Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz denied a Bloomberg report that Malaysia was eyeing a 20% tariff and said Malaysia is still on track to secure a trade deal with the US by the Aug 1 deadline at the lowest possible tariff.\nMMAG Holdings Bhd has entered into a conditional aircraft sale agreement to acquire a Boeing 737-800BCF freighter for US$25.9mn (RM109.9mn) cash.\nKeyfield International Bhd has secured 2 work orders from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of accommodation work boats to support the national oil company's offshore operations.\nKinergy Advancement Bhd has secured fee-in approvals for two hydropower projects with a total installed capacity of 8.04MW under the Sustainable Energy Development Authority's FiT 2.0 initiative.\nRimbunan Sawit Bhd has announced the termination of its JV with LCDA Holdings Sdn Bhd to develop a parcel of native customary rights land in Ulu Selangau, Sibu into an oil palm plantation.\nJentayu Sustainables Bhd said Sumitomo Corporation does not intend to extend a MoU the parties signed 2 years ago to collaborate on renewable energy projects.\nAYS Ventures Bhd said the voluntary takeover offer by its associate company 3HA Capital Pte Ltd for all shares in Singapore-listed CosmoSteel Holdings Ltd has become unconditional, after 3HA Capital's shareholding crossed the 50% threshold.\nCountry Heights Holdings Bhd's wholly-owned unit, Country Heights Commercial Development Sdn Bhd has been served with a winding-up petition by the Inland Revenue Board over RM312,560 in unpaid taxes.\nMetronic Global Bhd is ending its JV with Zhuhai SingYes New Materials Technology Co Ltd to develop and market smart city solutions across the country.\nKIP Real Estate Investment Trust's FY25 net property income surged 24.4% YoY to RM96.8mn, mainly driven by the contribution from its 7 KIPMalls and its 4 industrial properties, as well as the newly bought D'pulze Shopping Centre and TF Value-Mart.\nLuxchem Corporation Bhd's 2QFY25 net profit declined by 27.1% YoY to RM8.9mn amid lower sales from its business segments.\nBetamek Bhd's 1QFY26 net profit rose 10.5% YoY to RM5.4mn due to consistent favourable performance of the ringgit against the USD and the CNY as well as the better expenses monitoring by each unit of the group.\nThe Philippines aims to bring down the tariff imposed by the US on its exports to 15% from 19%.\nUS President Donald Trump suggested that he would not go below 15% as he sets so-called reciprocal tariff rates ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits in the US dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended July 19, the lowest level since April.\nS&P Global's flash US Composite PMI Output Index increased to 54.6 this month, the highest level since December, from 52.9 in June.\nSource:TA Research- 25 Jul 2025",

Sentiment stayed positive on reports of progress in US-EU trade talks, as well as hopes that the US-China trade truce would be extended next week as officials from both sides will meet in Stockholm.\nUS.Wall St ended mixed as strong GOOGL earnings powered the S&P 500 (+0.1%) and Nasdaq 100 (+0.2%) to new highs. Alphabet rose 1% after beating Q2 estimates and boosting its 2025 capex by USD10bn, fuelling gains in Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. Tesla sank 7.9% after Elon Musk warned of “challenging quarters” ahead. Meanwhile, the Dow slid 316 pts, weighed down by an 8% slide in IBM on weak revenue and a 4.7% drop in UnitedHealth, which disclosed a DOJ probe. After hours, INTL jumped 1.3% on positive results.\nMalaysia.The KLCI surged 10.5 pts to close at 1,540.3, driven by late-session buying amid positive hopes over US-Malaysia trade deals, and investor-friendly measures from the Anwar administration’s “Appreciation Package.” However, market breadth narrowed (1.06 vs 1.62 prior) as profit-taking set in, as turnover slipped 9.2% to 2.97bn shares worth RM2.30bn. Foreign funds turned net buyers (+RM22m) for a 2nd day (July MTD: -RM442m; YTD: -RM12.56bn). In contrast, local institutions (-RM4m; July MTD: +RM413m; YTD: +RM10.88bn) alongside retailers (-RM18m; July MTD: +RM29m; YTD: +RM1.68bn) emerged as major net sellers.\nTechnical viewThe KLCI seemed to have found its temporary footing after rebounding from our envisaged 1,510 (38.2% FR) support on 17-18 July. Following a strong reclaim above 20D/50D/100D MAs last two days to 1,540.3, the index is on a cusp of a bullish triangle breakout soon. A decisive breakout above the downtrend line (sloping line from YTD high of 1,586.9) could revive bullish momentum, targeting higher upside toward 1,551 (4 July high) and 1,564 (200D MA) next. On the flipside, a decisive drop below key support at 1,523 (50D MA) and 1,510 may trigger a deeper pullback toward 1,500 and 1,488 (23 June low).\nOutlookTechnically, the KLCI’s strong close above the 20D/50D/100D MAs at 1,540.3 suggests a bullish triangle breakout is imminent, with upside targets at 1,551–1,564. The rally is underpinned by market-friendly signals from Anwar’s “Appreciation Package,” returning foreign inflows, and optimism that recent trade pacts with Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines could pave the way for broader US-Asia deals.\nHowever, near-term sentiment could stay cautious amid several headwinds:\n•    Ongoing US-Malaysia tariff uncertainty•    Potentially muted August earnings season; historical August weakness (10Y/20Y/30Y avg: -0.7%/-1.2%/-2.2%)•    Domestic policy overhang from subsidy rationalisation and SST expansion, which may weigh on consumer sentiment and earnings visibility\nVIRTUAL PORTFOLIOYesterday, we had squared off our virtual portfolio positions on ITMAX (10.1% gain), SIMEPROP (1.3% gain) and DPHARMA (0.0%).\nSource: Hong Leong Investment Bank Research - 25 Jul 2025",

On corporate earnings, Alphabet beat 2Q25 revenue and EPS estimates, raising its AI capex to USD85bn, while Tesla missed expectations, with Musk warning of a few tough quarters ahead. Meanwhile, on the economic front, jobless claims remained lower than expected, signalling labour market resilience. Given the mixed corporate earnings and economic data, coupled with the overstretched market conditions, the market may warrant a slight pullback. In the commodities market, Brent crude, Gold and CPO traded at USD69/bbl, USD3,368/oz and RM4,330/MT respectively.\nMY: Selectively, we are noticing uptrend formation within several sectors that are related to utilities and data center. Also, we opine that investors can start accumulating banking stocks for long-term positions despite the recent OPR cut as Bursa Finance Index has declined around 10% from the YTD high. Valuations remain attractive, with the sector trading at 10x PE and 1.1x PB vs. its 10-year average of 12.3x and 1.2x, respectively. We favour MAYBANK, AMMB and RHBBANK attractive dividend yields. Meanwhile, the RM100 cash handouts and price caps on tolls and RON95 are expected to spur short-term consumer spending, benefiting companies like 99SMART, ECOSHOP, and MRDIY.\nStocks to watch:\nTechnology: *ADB*, *MTAG*, VITROXConsumer: *99SMART*, MFLOURUtility: *JTGROUP*, KJTSFinance: CIMB, MAYBANKConstruction: *SSB8*Building Material: *PMETAL*O&G: HAWK\nSource: M+ Global\nDisclaimer\nThe content published is solely for information and personal use only.
